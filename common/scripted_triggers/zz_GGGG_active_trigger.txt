# USAGE:
# Paste into a scripted_trigger file with a filename that comes ahead of this one in an alphanumeric sort (i.e. don't
# make it start with z) the following definition:
#
# GGGG_is_active_trigger = {
#     always = no
# }
#
# If GGGG is inactive, that trigger definition should be the one used by your mod, but if GGGG is active, it should be
# overwritten with the definition below, allowing you to tell when GGGG is active or not dynamically.

GGGG_is_active_trigger = {
    always = yes
}
